# Automatidata-Projects
This repository contains a series of data projects completed as part of the Automatidata course series. The projects use the same dataset provided by the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) and focus on various aspects of data analysis and machine learning to generate actionable insights.

# Overview of Projects

### 1. [Course 2: NYC Taxi Data Understanding](./Course2_NYC_Taxi_Data_Understanding)
- **Objective**: Investigate and organize NYC taxi data for initial analysis and preparation for further exploration.
- **Key Focus**: Dataframe creation, summary statistics, and variable exploration.

### 2. [Course 3: NYC Taxi Exploratory Data Analysis](./Course3_NYC_Taxi_Exploratory_Data_Analysis)
- **Objective**: Perform deeper EDA on the NYC taxi data to reveal trends and relationships.
- **Key Focus**: Data cleaning, visualization, and initial insights.

### 3. [Course 4: NYC Taxi A/B Testing and Insights](./Course4_NYC_Taxi_AB_Testing_and_Insights)
- **Objective**: Conduct A/B tests to identify ways to increase revenue for taxi drivers.
- **Key Focus**: Hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, and actionable business recommendations.

### 4. [Course 5: NYC Taxi Regression Model Evaluation](./Course5_NYC_Taxi_Regression_Model_Evaluation)
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model for predicting outcomes within the NYC taxi dataset.
- **Key Focus**: EDA, regression modeling, and interpreting results.

### 5. [Course 6: NYC Taxi Tipper Prediction Model](./Course6_NYC_Taxi_Tipper_Prediction_Model)
- **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a tip.
- **Key Focus**: Ethical considerations, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The NYC Yellow Taxi Trip dataset contains detailed trip records collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). It includes the following attributes:

- **Trip Details**: Pickup and drop-off times, locations, and trip distances.
- **Fare Information**: Fare amounts, tips, tolls, and payment methods.
- **Passenger Data**: Passenger count per trip.
- **Trip Metadata**: Vendor IDs and trip durations.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
