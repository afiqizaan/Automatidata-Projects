# Automatidata-Projects
This repository contains a series of data projects completed as part of the Automatidata course series. The projects use the same dataset provided by the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) and focus on various aspects of data analysis and machine learning to generate actionable insights.

# Overview of Projects

### 1. [Course 2 Project: NYC Taxi Data Understanding](./Course2_NYC_Taxi_Data_Understanding)
- **Objective**: This project investigates and organizes the provided NYC taxi cab dataset to inform future exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical activities.

### 2. [Course 4 Project: NYC Taxi A/B Testing and Insights](./Course4_NYC_Taxi_Regression_Model_Evaluation)
- **Objective**: Demonstrates knowledge of preparing, creating, and analyzing A/B tests to identify ways to increase revenue for taxi cab drivers.

### 2. [Course 5 Project: NYC Taxi Regression Model Evaluation](./Course5_NYC_Taxi_Regression_Model_Evaluation)
- **Objective**: Demonstrates the use of EDA and a multiple linear regression model to evaluate and generate insights.

### 3. [Course 6 Project: NYC Taxi Tipper Prediction Model](./Course6_NYC_Taxi_Tipper_Prediction_Model)
- **Objective**: Builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is a generous tipper, aiming to increase revenue for taxi cab drivers.
