# Automatidata-Projects
This repository contains a series of data projects completed as part of the Automatidata course series. The projects use the same dataset provided by the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) and focus on various aspects of data analysis and machine learning to generate actionable insights.

# Overview of Projects

### 1. [Course 2 Project: Exploratory Data Analysis](./Course2_Project)
- **Objective**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the NYC TLC dataset to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Key Focus**: Data cleaning, visualization, and summary statistics.

### 2. [Course 4 Project: Feature Engineering and Modeling](./Course4_Project)
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for machine learning by engineering features and building initial predictive models.
- **Key Focus**: Feature selection, transformations, and preliminary model training.

### 3. [Course 6 Project: Final Predictive Model](./Course6_Project)
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a final machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a tip.
- **Key Focus**: Model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment readiness.

## Dataset

The projects use the NYC Taxi dataset, which includes:
- Pickup and drop-off times, locations
- Fare amounts, trip distances
- Customer tipping behavior
